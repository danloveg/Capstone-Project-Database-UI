# Capstone Project User Interface - Group 17 2018-2019 Term

## Summary
This code is a part of Group 17's Capstone project for the Fall 2018/Winter 2019 terms.

This repository contains a user interface meant to allow a user to store folders containing DICOM data and import that data into [3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/). DICOM is a type of 2D medical image that is typically generated by CT scanning machines. The point of opening a collection of these 2D images in 3DSlicer is to create a 3D rendering of them that can be visualized on our target technology: the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/hololens).

The code is written using the C# WPF platform, and is meant to be run on Windows Vista and later. The database running behind the scenes of the code is SQLite, interactions with it are done with the [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) library. Note that this code is meant to be used in tandem with 3DSlicer so it must be installed and added to Window's PATH.

## Running the Code

### Using Pre-Compiled Executable
Download the zip file called `CapstoneInterface.zip` from the release tab, and run the file called `CapstoneUserInterface.exe` in the extracted folder.

### Building From Source
Open the solution file `CapstoneUserInterface/CapstoneUserInterface.sln` in Visual Studio. Then, build the project using the Release or Debug configuration. The compiled executable will either be in the `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release` folder depending on the build configuration used.

## Using the Code
There are two main operations allowed: adding a folder to the database, and opening a folder from the database up in 3DSlicer as a collection of DICOM data. Refer to the [flowchart](UI_flowchart.png) to find more information about how the code works.
